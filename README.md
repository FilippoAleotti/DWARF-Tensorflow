## Abstract
Scene flow is a challenging task aimed at jointly estimating the 3D structure and motion of the sensed environment.
Although deep learning solutions achieve outstanding performance in terms of accuracy, these approaches divide the
whole problem into standalone tasks (stereo and optical flow)
addressing them with independent networks. Such a strategy dramatically increases the complexity of the training
procedure and requires power-hungry GPUs to infer scene
flow barely at 1 FPS. Conversely, we propose DWARF, a
novel and lightweight architecture able to infer full scene
flow jointly reasoning about depth and optical flow easily
and elegantly trainable end-to-end from scratch. Moreover,
since ground truth images for full scene flow are scarce,
we propose to leverage on the knowledge learned by networks specialized in stereo or flow, for which much more
data are available, to distill proxy annotations. Exhaustive
experiments show that i) DWARF runs at about 10 FPS
on a single high-end GPU and about 1 FPS on NVIDIA
Jetson TX2 embedded at KITTI resolution, with moderate drop in accuracy compared to 10Ã— deeper models, ii)
learning from many distilled samples is more effective than
from the few, annotated ones available.

## Requirements
The code has been tested with python3 and Tensorflow 1.10.
Dependencies may be installed running  

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to use the [KITTI evaluation suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php), you need to install:

```Bash
sudo apt-get install libpng++-dev
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
```
**Note**: gcc and g++ version should have version 5

## Proxy labels generation

Proxy labels have been generated using the network proposed by Ilg et al. in [Occlusions, Motion and Depth Boundaries with
a Generic Network for Disparity, Optical Flow
or Scene Flow Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01838.pdf).
**WE DO NOT** make them available for download. You can generate these proxy by your own running their code, available [here](https://github.com/lmb-freiburg/netdef_models).

## Times

We took inference time using CUDA layers for 1D, 2D and 3D correlations. However, we notice that these layers are unstable and do not guarantee the same results for consecutive inferences, so we suggest to use tensorflow implementations for testing.
